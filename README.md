# Afterhours LLM Service Monorepo

This monorepo contains all of the backend, frontend, and IaC code for the _Afterhours LLM Service_.

## About

The _Afterhours LLM Service_ provides API access to large language models (LLMs) for authorized
users via API keys. The API is meant to be used for [Praxis Engineering](https://praxiseng.com)
"Afterhours" projects that require access to LLMs that are too big to run on local development
machines.
